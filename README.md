# Save Walter White

Clon of Breaking Bad's Save Walter White website

---- SPOILERS ----

SaveWalterWhite.com is the website created by Walter White Jr. in order to raise donation money for his father's rising medical costs. Saul Goodman, convinces Walt that the best option he has for laundering his drug money is by sending small, but consistent donations through the website with the help of one of Saul's computer hacker friends "Phoenix". The plan inevitably works, but the results are a lot different than initially expected.
